# RDA-aware DAS: Detailed Implementation Checklist

## RDA Primer for Software Engineers

### What RDA means in this project

RDA here means Robust Distributed Array.

Think of it as a deterministic way to spread data symbols across a peer grid so that:

- Sampling can be done with low-latency local-subnet queries (row/column locality).
- Missing symbols can be recovered by syncing from peers that should own those symbols.
- Every accepted symbol is validated by a predicate (Pred(h, i, x)) instead of trusting transport success alone.

In short, Robust Distributed Array is the data placement and retrieval topology, while DAS is the service that verifies availability using that topology.

### Core model (shared vocabulary)

- h: handle (typically data root / block-linked identifier).
- i: share index.
- x: symbol payload with proof.
- Pred(h, i, x): validation function that must pass before data is considered valid.

Node placement and symbol routing are deterministic:

- PeerID maps to grid coordinates (row, col).
- Symbol index i maps to a target column via Cell(i).
- Query path typically targets peers in the same relevant row/column subnet first.

This determinism is important because it gives predictable retry, load distribution, and recovery behavior.

### Mental model of the protocol flow

1. STORE phase (write/distribute path)

- Producer-side pushes symbols into the RDA topology.
- Receiving nodes validate with Pred(h, i, x) before storing.
- Data is forwarded according to row/column policy to ensure robust placement.

2. GET phase (sampling/read path)

- DAS requests symbols from the RDA grid using (h, i).
- Requester chooses candidate peers deterministically (with retry order).
- Returned symbols are accepted only if Pred(h, i, x) passes.

3. SYNC phase (repair/catchup path)

- New/recovering nodes ask subnet peers for missing symbols.
- Synced symbols are validated, deduplicated, then committed.
- This supports recovery without reverting to expensive full-network scans.

### How this changes DAS behavior

Classic DAS is mostly "sample via availability interface and retry by height".

RDA-aware DAS becomes:

- "sample by symbol/query path" inside each target header.
- Retry policy driven by RDA errors (timeout, peer unavailable, invalid proof).
- Optional fallback to classic path when robust distributed array path is unhealthy.
- Extra state for per-symbol failures (not only per-height failures).

### Non-negotiable invariants

- Never accept a symbol if Pred(h, i, x) fails.
- Never let SYNC overwrite newer valid data with stale data.
- Never start RDA sampling before subnet discovery/lifecycle is ready.
- Always keep a safe fallback path (at least in hybrid mode rollout).

### Common misunderstandings to avoid

- RDA is not a replacement name for DAS. RDA is the topology/protocol; DAS is the sampling service.
- Successful network response is not equivalent to valid data. Predicate verification is mandatory.
- High retry count is not "robustness" by itself. Deterministic retry + bounded policy + fallback is robustness.
- Metrics that are declared but not wired provide no operational confidence.

### Practical engineering guidance

- Keep classic mode intact first, then enable robust distributed array path behind a flag.
- Implement GET correctness before worker orchestration changes.
- Add checkpoint versioning before persisting new per-symbol state.
- Treat observability as a feature, not a follow-up task.

## Terminology (must be explicit)

- [ ] RDA in this document means Robust Distributed Array (not Random Data Availability, not generic redundancy term).
- [ ] Add the same clarification to PR description, design docs, and commit messages.
- [ ] Keep naming consistent in code/comments:
  - [ ] "RDA" for Robust Distributed Array topology/protocol.
  - [ ] "DAS" for Data Availability Sampling service.
  - [ ] "RDA-aware DAS" for DAS that uses Robust Distributed Array protocols for sampling/recovery.

## 0) Goal and Scope

- [ ] Migrate current DAS from header-only sampling flow to RDA-aware sampling flow.
- [ ] Keep backward compatibility: support classic DAS and RDA DAS side-by-side (feature flag).
- [ ] Preserve existing APIs where possible, then extend with RDA-specific observability and controls.
- [ ] Avoid regressions for bridge/light startup, catchup, checkpoint resume, and fraud proof handling.
- [ ] Preserve robust distributed array invariants:
  - [ ] Deterministic peer-to-cell mapping.
  - [ ] Subnet locality (row/column) for query path.
  - [ ] Predicate validation Pred(h, i, x) before accepting symbol.

## 1) Target Architecture Decisions (must finalize first)

- [x] Decide runtime mode strategy:
  - [x] Classic only
  - [x] RDA only
  - [x] Hybrid (recommended: canary and fallback)
- [x] Decide where RDA sampling logic lives:
  - [ ] Inside das worker/coordinator (new RDA strategy layer)
  - [ ] Inside share availability implementation (adapter model)
  - [x] Hybrid (recommended: strategy in das + transport in share/rda protocols)
- [ ] Define fallback policy:
  - [x] RDA query timeout -> retry peer
  - [x] Exceed retries -> fallback to existing light availability path
  - [x] Policy and thresholds configurable
- [ ] Define production readiness criteria:
  - [ ] Correctness (proof validation + data recovery)
  - [ ] Catchup behavior
  - [ ] Performance budget (latency/throughput)
  - [ ] Operability (metrics/logs/debuggability)

### 1.1 RDA (Robust Distributed Array) design decisions

- [x] Define canonical symbol model for robust distributed array flow:
  - [x] h = handle/data root.
  - [x] i = share index.
  - [x] x = symbol payload + proof.
- [ ] Define canonical mapping function for robust distributed array:
  - [ ] Cell(i) -> target column c.
  - [ ] peer(row, c) selection policy (deterministic + retry order).
- [ ] Define robust distributed array proof policy:
  - [ ] required proof fields.
  - [ ] strict verification failures and error codes.
  - [ ] acceptable soft failures (timeouts/temporary peer absence).
- [ ] Define robust distributed array recovery policy:
  - [ ] when to trigger SYNC.
  - [ ] when to trigger fallback to classic path.
  - [ ] how to mark sample as terminal failure.

## 2) Configuration and Feature Flags

### Files

- [x] nodebuilder/das/config.go
- [x] nodebuilder/das/module.go
- [x] nodebuilder/das/constructors.go
- [ ] nodebuilder/share/config.go

### Tasks

- [x] Add DAS mode config (example: das_mode = classic|rda|hybrid).
- [x] Add RDA DAS tuning knobs:
  - [x] rda_query_timeout
  - [x] rda_max_retries
  - [x] rda_parallel_queries
  - [x] rda_fallback_enabled
  - [x] rda_fallback_after_retries
  - [x] rda_sync_on_catchup
  - [x] rda_mode_strict_predicate (fail-fast vs tolerant mode)
  - [x] rda_min_peers_per_subnet
  - [x] rda_sync_batch_size
  - [x] rda_checkpoint_version
- [x] Validate config combinations (invalid combinations fail fast). (implemented for mode validation and initial RDA fallback/retry constraints)
- [ ] Default values:
  - [ ] Safe defaults for migration (hybrid with fallback enabled).
- [x] Plumb config into fx wiring and constructor chain.
- [x] Add config migration notes from old TOML (if fields renamed/split).

### Config Migration Notes

- [x] Existing DAS settings remain backward compatible with classic defaults (`enabled=true`, `mode=classic`).
- [x] New RDA knobs are additive; old TOML without these fields falls back to defaults from `das.DefaultParameters()`.
- [x] `hybrid` mode now requires `rda_fallback_enabled=true`; invalid combinations fail fast at startup.

### Done Criteria

- [x] Node starts with classic mode unchanged.
- [x] Node starts with rda/hybrid mode and wiring succeeds.
- [x] Invalid config combinations return clear error messages.

- [ ] Harden response contract:
